# ~Captcha~ Ketchup
MVP Project - An endless captcha game... well, endless until time runs out.
**As of 8/9/2022, the project is deployed [here](http://ec2-13-56-211-7.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/captcha).**

## What is this? üßê
This is a fun little game I coded up within 3 days. After completing the initial Google ReCaptcha check, the player must complete as many captchas as possible before time runs out. Initially the time limit is 2 minutes, but completing each captcha extends the timer by 2 seconds. Additionally each captcha awards points upon completion-- text captchas award 1 point, image captchas award 2 points, and sound captchas award 3. Text captchas are randomly selected from a selection of 1000+ pieces of text captchas. Image captchas are randomly generated from the following groups: cats, dogs, ducks, bears, waifus, and Keanu Reeves. The images of cats, dogs, ducks, bears, waifus, and Keanu Reeves are all obtained from respective APIs. Sound captchas are randomly selected from a word bank and then spoken using the browser's built-in speech synthesis function. After time runs out, the player's score and the total time survived is logged and submitted to a database once the player inputs a username. Also, there is a button on the top right of the screen to mute the audio.
